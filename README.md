# NLP project file explanations

#### Baseline model
The code for the implementation of the baseline model is stored in `TFIDF_mod.py` and `run_TFIDF.py`.

#### SpanBERT
The code for fine-tuning the pre-trained SpanBERT model is stored in `SpanBERT.py` and `run_SpanBERT.py`. The training process is recorded in the file `Training_process`. The file `utils.py` contains necessary functions used for this project.

Due to the large size of the fine-tuned model, the best model is saved as `best_model.pt` in the shared google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1phi9N2FJHl8cTwjZyQDG8LEp6CEBzN7o?usp=share_link
